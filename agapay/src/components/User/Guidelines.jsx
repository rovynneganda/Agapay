                      Fire is a natural phenomenon that occurs when a
                      combustible material reacts with an oxidizing agent,
                      usually oxygen, in the presence of heat. It releases
                      energy in the form of light and heat. Fires can occur in
                      various environments and are essential for human survival
                      as they provide warmth, light, and a means for cooking.
                      However, uncontrolled fires can be extremely dangerous,
                      leading to widespread destruction and loss of life.

                    <p className="leading-relaxed  font-poppins">
                      An earthquake is a natural geological phenomenon
                      characterized by the sudden release of energy in the
                      Earth's crust, resulting in seismic waves. This release of
                      energy is typically caused by the movement of tectonic
                      plates beneath the Earth's surface. When these plates
                      collide, pull apart, or slide against each other, stress
                      builds up in the Earth's crust. When this stress is
                      suddenly released, it generates seismic waves that cause
                      the ground to shake. Earthquakes can vary in magnitude,
                      from imperceptible tremors to devastating events capable
                      of causing widespread destruction, landslides, tsunamis,
                      and loss of life.

                      to 700 kilometers per hour (500 miles per hour) in the

                      A landslide is a geological phenomenon involving the
                      movement of a mass of rock, earth, or debris down a slope.
                      This movement can be slow and gradual or sudden and rapid,
                      resulting in significant changes in the landscape.
                      Landslides occur when the force of gravity exceeds the
                      strength of the materials holding the slope together,
                      causing them to collapse and move downhill.

                      A flood is an overflow of water that submerges land that
                      is usually dry. Floods can occur due to various factors,
                      including heavy rainfall, snowmelt, storm surges, or the
                      failure of dams or levees. Floods can cause widespread
                      damage to infrastructure, homes, and agriculture. They
                      often lead to the displacement of people, loss of lives,
                      and disruption of communities. Floods can occur slowly
                      over time, such as riverine floods, or suddenly with
                      little or no warning, as in flash floods. Floods are a
                      natural part of the Earth's hydrological cycle, but their
                      impact can be mitigated through proper planning,
                      infrastructure, and disaster preparedness measures.

                      A tropical cyclone is a powerful and organized system of
                      clouds and thunderstorms with a defined circulation
                      pattern that forms over warm tropical and subtropical
                      oceans. This weather phenomenon is characterized by low
                      atmospheric pressure at its center, which is surrounded by
                      strong winds and heavy rainfall. Tropical cyclones can
                      cause significant damage due to their strong winds, storm
                      surges, and heavy rainfall, leading to flooding,
                      landslides, and coastal erosion.

                      A volcanic eruption is a natural disaster that occurs when
                      there is a sudden release of magma, ash, gases, and other
                      materials from a volcano. This release can be explosive,
                      leading to the ejection of rocks, ash clouds, and lava
                      flows. Volcanic eruptions can cause widespread damage to
                      the surrounding environment, including destruction of
                      landscapes, buildings, and infrastructure. They may also
                      result in secondary hazards such as ashfall, pyroclastic
                      flows, tsunamis (if the volcano is located near a body of
                      water), and lahars (mudflows). Volcanic eruptions are a
                      result of the Earth's geological activity, where molten
                      rock beneath the Earth's surface rises and erupts, often
                      triggered by tectonic movements or pressure buildup within
                      the volcano.

                      A storm surge is a rapid and significant rise in sea level
                      generated by a powerful storm, typically a tropical
                      cyclone or hurricane, as it moves over an ocean or a large
                      body of water. Storm surges can cause severe coastal
                      flooding and are one of the most dangerous aspects of a
                      tropical storm, often resulting in extensive damage to
                      coastal areas.
